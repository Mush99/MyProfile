				I’m Sri Lankan born and migrated to Australia in 2010, I’ve been an Australian citizen since 2015. <br> I follow the religion of Islam and have been practicing it since birth. So, most of my culture is around  <br> Sri Lankan Muslims, which is different from the norm of Sri Lanka. As I come from Sri Lanka, I know  <br> the language Tamil, I only know basic phrases and words, however, can understand it well. I started my  <br> studies in Australia from year 4, in a small country town called Keith located in South Australia. I did my  <br> middle school years in Queensland, and finally finished my schooling in Victoria. I successfully  <br> competed my VCE studies at Point Cook Secondary College.  <br>
				<b><br> Fun Fact</b> – I’ve played cricket for all the schools I’ve been to and have even won awards.

				I’ve been interested in IT since middle school when I got my first laptop. I was fascinated by how websites were developed   <br> and designed just by small lines of codes, so I decided to try and learn simple ways I could make websites. Then once I got   <br>to high school, we could choose IT as a subject, and with that my interest in IT sparked and I decided I want to do a profession   <br>relating to website developing and designing. This was how my interest in IT came to life, specifically for web developing and designing.  
				<br>
				  <br>
				  <br>
				RMIT was my first preference to come and purse my degree in IT, as I’ve heard many great things about the technology department  <br> from my school, peers who ever enrolled in university and my parents. Before I made RMIT my first preference I did my own research into the   <br>university, by going on their website and checking all the courses I wanted to do and compared it to my other preferences. My high school also took us to an   <br>excursion to RMIT to show what it has to offer to its new students, and after that I decided I wanted to do my studies there.  
  				  <br>
  				<br>
  				  <br>
				I’m currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology, and as the course has a wide array of subjects, I plan on mainly  <br> focusing on the coding and web developing section. However, I also will be actively trying to learn the other aspects of  <br> this course, as having many skills will aid me in the future when I’m looking to join the work force. I also hope to do a honours with these course and help   <br>it shape my pathway to higher pathways, such as acquiring my masters.

				The job requires a web developer to work for their agency, they have top tier clients, for over 20 years. <br>This job is appealing for me as I’m really interested in developing websites, so doing this job would be satisfying for me personally.  
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Skills needed for this job are knowing the language HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Other skills needed are to be familiar<br> with programs such as Linux, .NET, Webpack and Grunt. Also, a social skill of being able to communicate with large groups and being able to follow orders.  
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Currently skills that I have for this job are knowing the basics of the three language, however it is possible for <br>me to expand my knowledge for these languages. Similarly, I have social skills to be able to work in large groups and take orders, as well as give orders.  
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				To obtain the skills of knowing Linux, .NET, Webpack and Grunt, I need to get hands on and learn it by myself. <br>Similarly, I can also watch tutorials on how to do the basics of these programs. I also can greatly expand my knowledge on the<br> programming languages, which will be extremely useful for me to get the job. Instead of having<br> basic skills, having advance skills will increase me opportunity to acquire the job.

				Project

				Overview
				<br>
					<br>
					<br>
				My project is a console game, which is heavily influenced by the mobile game “Flappy Bird”. Console gamers never had the chance to experience the	<br> worldwide hit game “Flappy bird” for themselves, so I want to give them that experience. The game won’t be an exact copy of the mobile game, because 	<br>consoles can handle more graphics and performance, the game will be 3D and have more elements implemented to it, such as power ups, new skins, 	<br>and more obstacles to bypass. Similarly, to “Flappy Bird” there is no end to the game and will be infinite, so users around the world can try	<br> beating each other's score, as scores will be put online for people to compete. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Motivation
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The reason I want to create a game like “Flappy Bird” is because I remember how fun it was when it first came out, the countless hours I<br> spent playing the game and it links me to memories of middle school. So, I want to relive those moments but want to add a twist to it and enjoy <br>it with better graphics and attributes and bringing it to the console is the best way. Another reason I want to remake “Flappy Bird”, is so<br> kids of this generation can also experience what we did and show them how challenging games can be. Finally, it is a way for gamers to pay for a<br> game and be able to enjoy it for a long time as every time you lose you know you can start again and try beating your high score or the rest of the worlds.  
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Description
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				“Rappy Bird” will be a single player game, that will be available for consoles such as the Xbox, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Like many games <br>it will consist of an online leader board, which will be broken in too few categories. The categories will <br>be; Local, which compares you to the people on your friends list, Nation. which compares you to the people that are currently living in the same country as you, World Wide.<br> Which compares you to the whole globe. Being in the top ten in the two categories of Nation and World Wide will reward players with daily in-game currency so they can spend it at the shop to buy <br>skins, etc. Continuing from the in-game currency, depending on how far you can get on each run players are rewarded with Rappies which the in-game currency is, <br>and can be used at the shop. The currency will not be purchasable with money unlike most games and will have to be earned, so it gives more committed players the rewards they deserve.<br> The shop will mainly consist of skins for players to customise their birds with, skins will be a reasonable price and will have rarity to them depending on each <br>skin. Skins will all be purchasable by Rappies, and can’t be bought with real currency, so only players that are committed will have the satisfaction of <br>owning rare skins. Also, in the shop different sceneries can be bought, sceneries don’t add any boost or specialties and are just there for aesthetics. The main game will consist of pipes, <br>buildings, etc depending on the scenery that the player must try and avoid, the further they get the faster their character gets and higher and lower the obstacles <br>are. Other obstacles that must be avoided are other birds, clouds, rubbish thrown, etc. 
						<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Tools & Skills
						<br>
				<br>
				<br> 
				The game will be running on Unreal Engine 4, as it will give the best graphics and performance for consoles to run. Also, open sources<br> will be used to get some of the classic “Flappy Bird” aesthetics to be used in the default world and character. Skills needed for<br> this will be me needing to have an advance amount of knowledge on Unreal Engine 4 and its language so I can add all the new aspects that I want to <br>implement, similarly I need to know how to know reach my target audience and what entertain them. As the game is pretty much a reboot, I need to engineer it so it can capture the eyes <br>of the old generation users and to capture the new generation of users. So, not only will I need skills for computers, but also, <br>I need social skills to capture my audience to enjoy my game.  
					<br>
				<br>
				<br> 
				Outcome
					<br>
				<br>
				<br> 
				If my project is successful, I’ll be proud that I was able to bring something I found fond in the past back to life and be able to share<br> it with the new generation. There won’t be a problem solved, or it won’t bring much to the world, but it will bring happiness <br>to the people that spent countless hours mastering it and will be able to enjoy it once again. Also show the new generation, how simple games <br>can bring so much fun and how they can spend so much time improving themselves.
